Rationale and Explanations: This library has 4 classes associated with graphs. One class for Nodes, one class for edges, one class for a GraphADT and a Graph class that extends the GraphADT.
In order to create a graph of your own create another Graph class that extends GraphADT of Graph to implement its functionality. 
This library also has a PathFinder interface which is implemented by a Djikstra path finding algorithm in the ShortestPathAlgorithm class. You use this interface and create your own path finding algoritm if needed.
